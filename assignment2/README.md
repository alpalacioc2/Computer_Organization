##  Project Information  
**Name:** Alejandro Caro (APC)  
**Date:** June 26th, 2025  
**Class:** CDA 3100 – Computer Organization I  
**Assignment:** #4 – Process five integers, convert them to floats, and calculate sum, mean, range, and variance.  

---

##  Description  
This MIPS assembly program prompts the user to enter **five integers**, converts them to **floating-point numbers**, and performs several statistical calculations:  

-  **Floating-point conversion** → Convert integer inputs to floats  
-  **List output** → Display all five floats  
-  **Sum** → Compute the total sum of the five numbers  
-  **Min/Max** → Identify the smallest and largest values  
-  **Mean** → Compute the arithmetic average  
-  **Variance** → Compute the **sample variance** using formula


##  How to Run  

1. Copy the `.asm` file into your working directory.  
2. Open **MARS** or **QtSpim** MIPS simulator.  
3. Load the program:  
   - `File > Open > assignment4.asm`  
4. Assemble and run the program.  
5. Enter **five integers** when prompted.  
6. View the floating-point list and calculated statistics.
